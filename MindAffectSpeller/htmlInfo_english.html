		<h1>MindAffect Speller</h1>
		<p>At MindAffect we build technology to control devices using brain activity: <i>Brain Computer Interfaces</i>, or <i>BCIs</i>. Using this app, an EEG headset and our Decoding device, you can communicate just by looking at the buttons that you wish to press.</p>
		
		<p>Beneath you find some general information about MindAffect as well as help with using this app.</p>
		
		
		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>The development of our BCI started at the Radboud University. Thanks to winning the Prize4Life, a project was started to bring this amazing technology to locked-in patients. The company MindAffect was founded, with the goal of helping patients, but also to apply BCI for other use cases.</p>
		
		<p>We have demonstrated with a patient in Belgium that our BCI can help some locked-in patients. However, at this moment in time we have not reached the point of a certified, and hence sellable, product, nor have we found a business model to support such a solution in a sustainable way.</p>
		
		<p>Therefore we decided to shift our focus from locked-in patients to developing a more general purpose development kit. This way we allow people around the world to assemble a BCI-solution, and tailor the application to their specific needs.</p>
		
		<p>Are you interested in developing your own BCI? Please check out <a href="https://www.mindaffect.nl">www.mindaffect.nl</a>. We are also looking for companies that want to do a project together. Do you want to explore with us what the future of BCI will bring? Feel free to get in touch!</p>
		
		
		<h2>Help</h2>
		
		<p>This app is intended to be used together with an EEG headset and a <i>MindAffect Decoder</i>. Check out our site to complete your BCI setup: <a href="https://www.mindaffect.nl">www.mindaffect.nl</a>.</p>
		
		<p>In order to control this app using your brain, follow these steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Setup your MindAffect Decoder and EEG headset.</li>
			<li>Open the Settings app and connect your iPad to the Decoder&apos;s wifi network.</li>
			<li>Open this app, go to the Start screen and press the Brain button in the top-right corner.</li>
			<li>Follow the instructions in order to connect the app to the Decoder and calibrate the system.</li>
			<li>After exiting the Calibration screen, the buttons will begin to flicker. Now you should be able to press one by looking at it!</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>Beneath we clarify some things that might not immediately be clear.</p>
		
		<h3>Start screen</h3>
		<p>The Start screen provides some basic functions, such as saying predefined sentences or ringing a bell, as well as access to all other screens.</p>
		
		<h3>Connection indicator</h3>
		<p>If there is no connection with the MindAffect Decoder, a red dot will be visible in the bottom-right corner of the screen.</p>
		
		<h3>Start/stop flicker</h3>
		<p>By swiping up or down with one finger, you can start/stop the flickering.</p>
		
		<h3>Sleep screen</h3>
		<p>Because some users might not be able to swipe up or down, we added the <i>Sleep screen</i>. You enter this screen by pressing the Zzz button in the top-left of the Start screen. Enter this screen when you want a break, with minimal light and flickering.</p>
		
		<h3>Spelling screen</h3>
		<p>By pressing the keyboard icon in the Start screen, you enter the <i>Spelling screen</i>, where you can type text and let it be spoken out loud. Use the Pause button if you temporarily want to minimise the flickering.</p>
